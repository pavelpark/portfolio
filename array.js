    paragraph: '<p>My name is Pavel Parkhomey I am 18 years old, I was born in Ukraine i moved to to United States in 2007. It took me longer then other kids to learn English at school. I finished elementary school with out speaking any English, in middle school I started getting better at understanding people but I still had some trouble with reading and vocabulary. When I got to high school it was a challenge for me to understand what teachers wanted from me, so it took me longer to do my assignments. Then after high school I worked for Aldo USA it was a great place for me to get better communication skills and get better at working with other people. Now I attend Code Fellows and hope to become IOS Developer one day.</p>'
