User Stories:

As an employer: I would like to see developers story and what their background, then I would like to skim through the developer’s projects and see the skills that he/she has and take a look at the resume of the developer and see the work history that he/she has done, then I would like to be able to contact the developer some how so it would be nice to have the contact information included on the bottom of the page.


As User: I would like to have a mobile version of the website so when I’m on the go I can always open up the website on my phone, and have easy access to other pages with a simple navigation bar.


As a marketer: I would like the user to see all the product that my corporation can provide and a great way to display all the product on the phone as well as on the tablets and on computers.


As a developer: I want to make the website user friendly and simple and phone accessible so that when the user is on the go they can rely on the phone website to respond with the same information.
